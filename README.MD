# Climate Change Impact Predictor

![Project Banner](app/assets/banner.png)

A machine learning application that predicts climate change impacts using satellite data from Google Earth Engine.

## Features

- üåç Interactive exploration of climate data from satellites
- ü§ñ Machine learning models (Random Forest and Neural Networks) for impact prediction
- üìä Dashboard for visualizing results and trends
- üõ∞Ô∏è Direct integration with Google Earth Engine API

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- data/: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- models/: Saved machine learning models.
- src/: Source code for data processing, modeling and visualizations.
- app/: Streamlit application code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climate-change-impact-predictor.git
   cd climate-change-impact-predictor
2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up Google Earth Engine authentication
- Create a Google Earth Engine account.
- run earthengine authenticate in your terminal and follow the instructions.
## Note
- Run authentication
   ''' bash
     earthengine authenticator
- A browser window will open to log in with the your GEE-approved Google account.
- Copy the authorization code back to the terminal.
- Set up service account
- Place the private key json file in the project root.
- Add to .env
GEE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT = your-service-account@project.iam.gseriveaccount.com
GEE_SERVICE_KEY_PATH = private_key_json.
- Download the satellite data
 python -m src.data.download_data
- Process the Data
 python -m src.data.preprocess_data
- Train the models
- Train the random_forest model
python -m src.models.train_rf
- Train the neural_network model
python -m src.models.train_nn
-Finally run the streamlit
5. Run the application
   streamlit run app/main.py
